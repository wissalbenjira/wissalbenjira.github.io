About Me
======

I am a first year PhD student at DVRC and IGN.
Under the co-supervision of [Nicolas Travers](https://chewbii.com/accueil/cv/) and [Bénédicte Bucher](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/benedicte-bucher/), and with the co-advisory guidance of [Malika Grim-Yefsah](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/malika-grim-yefsah/) and [Faten Atigui](https://cedric.cnam.fr/lab/en/author/atigui/), I am pursuing advanced research in Computer Science.

My current research  revolves around Information Systems for Decision Support and focuses on the exploration of Open Data to develop City Sustainability Indicators [(SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/en/goals).
