About Me
======

After holding a M.S. in Data Science and AI, I currently stand as a first-year PhD student at DeVinci Research Center [(DVRC)](https://www.devinci.fr/research-center/) and the Laboratory of Geographic Information Sciences and Technologies [(LASTIG)](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/).

Under the co-supervision of [Nicolas Travers](https://chewbii.com/accueil/cv/) and [Bénédicte Bucher](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/benedicte-bucher/), and with the co-advisory guidance of [Malika Grim-Yefsah](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/malika-grim-yefsah/) and [Faten Atigui](https://cedric.cnam.fr/lab/en/author/atigui/), I am pursuing advanced research in 
Computer Science.

My ongoing research revolves around Information Systems for Decision Support and focuses on the exploration of Open Data to develop City Sustainability Indicators.
