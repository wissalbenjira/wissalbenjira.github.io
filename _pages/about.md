About Me
======

I am a first year PhD student at DVRC and IGN.
Under the co-direction of [Nicolas Travers](https://chewbii.com/accueil/cv/) and [Bénédicte Bucher](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/benedicte-bucher/), and with the co-advisory guidance of [Malika Grim-Yefsah](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/malika-grim-yefsah/) and [Faten Atigui](https://cedric.cnam.fr/lab/en/author/atigui/), I am pursuing advanced research in Computer Science specialized in Information Systems for Decision Support.

My current research focuses on the exploration of open data to develop city sustainability indicators demonstrated through a case study on sport event legacy on host cities.
